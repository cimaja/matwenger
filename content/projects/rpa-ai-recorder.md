## Overview

As Product Designer at Microsoft, I led the design of the AI Recorder feature for Power Automate Desktop, revolutionizing how users create automated workflows. This innovative tool combines RPA (Robotic Process Automation) with AI to automatically record user actions and convert them into editable flows, making automation accessible to users of all technical levels.

## Key responsibilities

- Designed an intuitive recording interface that captures user actions while maintaining context
- Created a seamless experience for converting recorded actions into Power Automate Desktop flows
- Developed AI-powered features for action recognition and flow optimization
- Implemented natural language processing to improve flow readability
- Designed the flow editing and validation experience
- Ensured seamless integration with the Power Automate Desktop ecosystem

## Impact

The RPA AI Recorder significantly improved the automation development experience:
- 60% reduction in time spent creating desktop flows
- Increased accessibility of RPA to non-technical users
- Improved flow reliability through AI-powered action recognition
- Enhanced user productivity with smart action suggestions
- Seamless integration with existing Power Automate Desktop workflows
