## Overview

AI Builder is a feature of [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/) that allows you to create and use AI models to optimize your business processes. You can either use prebuilt models for common business scenarios or create custom models tailored to your specific needs. [AI Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/overview) helps automate processes and gain insights from your data in [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) and [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/).

With AI Builder, you can:

- Add intelligence to your business by integrating AI models with [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) and [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/).
- Choose from a variety of AI model types, such as form processing, object detection, and prediction.
- Connect your business-specific data to train and tailor your AI models.
- Use the insights generated by your AI models to create solutions that meet your business needs, even without coding skills.

For example, you can create a flow in [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/) to automate document processing or an app in [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance.
