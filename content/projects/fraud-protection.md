## Overview

In todayâ€™s digitally transformed world, enterprises operate largely online and in real time, with minimal human intervention. While this reduces costs and enhances customer experience, it also exposes businesses to significant risks. In e-commerce, for example, malicious activities such as account takeovers, stolen payment instruments, fake product reviews, and various types of fraud (warranty, refund, reseller, and program discount abuse) can harm profitability and reputation.

The main challenge was quickly onboarding this project and making tactical decisions to shape the product direction. I established the foundational framework with a focus on the acquisition funnel. My goal was to design an experience that allowed potential customers to use their historical data to test our fraud engine and uncover insights into fraud issues within their environment.

## Key responsibilities

- Designed fraud detection dashboards
- Created risk assessment visualizations
- Developed real-time monitoring interfaces
- Implemented alert management systems
- Designed case management workflows

## Impact

The Fraud Protection system transformed enterprise security:
- Accelerated fraud detection through real-time monitoring and alerts
