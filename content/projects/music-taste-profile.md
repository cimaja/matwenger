## Overview

I joined the Groove Universal App team as a Product Designer under the supervision of Claudio Guglieri. My primary focus was to enhance the onboarding experience, making it more personal and delightful. I collaborated closely with the research team to identify problem statements and uncover opportunities. My contributions included creating user flows, wireframes, prototypes, animations, and redlines, while also partnering with engineering teams to bring the concept to life across Windows 10, mobile platforms (iOS and Android), and Xbox consoles.

## Key responsibilities

- Collaborated with the research team to identify problem statements and define opportunities.
- Created user flows, wireframes, prototypes, and motions.
- Conducted user testing to gather feedback and iterate on designs.

## Impact

The Music Taste Profile system achieved remarkable results:
- 16% higher user engagement
- Improved accuracy in recommendations
- Positive user feedback on personalization
