## Overview

As Product Designer at Microsoft, I revamped the Xbox support experience to improve user satisfaction and reduce support costs. The project focused on creating an intuitive self-service system while maintaining high-quality support interactions. The Xbox Support team at Microsoft intakes thousands of customer support requests per day through multiple channels and platforms. With the growing percentage of mobile traffic, we decided to create a dedicated site optimized for mobile users. I've created wireframes and flows to adapted the work previously done for desktop on mobile and contracted a local design agency to help me with the visual direction.

## Key responsibilities

- Redesigned the support portal interface
- Created intelligent troubleshooting flows
- Developed self-service diagnostic tools
- Designed knowledge base system

## Impact

The Xbox Support redesign delivered great results:
- 14% reduction in support tickets
- Improved self-service success rate
- Reduced support costs
- Higher customer satisfaction scores
